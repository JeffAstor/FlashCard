# FlashCard Application

An advanced PyQt5-based flash card application for creating, editing, and studying flash card sets with multimedia content support and AI-powered card generation.

## Comments

Thank you for checking out my application! What started as a simple need to create flash cards turned into a Python development project. This entire application was built using AI-assisted developmentâ€”I create the plans and guide the AI through implementation.

The project was developed using Claude Sonnet 4 over approximately 10 hours, resulting in about 8,000 lines of code (roughly 1,000 lines per hour!).  For reference the average programmer might write 20 to 200 lines per day.  I wanted this project to demonstrates the level of productivity possible with AI-assisted development.

Getting it running on your machine is really not that hard ðŸ˜Š. The AI features work out of the box since they connect to my hosted server. For full details about the AI server architecture, check out `AI_SERVER_README.md`â€”it's a Flask server hosted on PythonAnywhere.

**Platform Notes:**
- **macOS**: Works seamlessly out of the box
- **Windows**: Requires **LAVFilters** installation for audio/video playback (the app runs without it, but Qt5 needs codec support for media files)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (recommended: Python 3.10+)
- PyQt5 >= 5.15.0
- Pillow >= 8.0.0

### Windows-Specific Requirements

For proper audio and video playback on Windows systems, **LAVFilters** must be installed:

- **LAVFilters**: DirectShow multimedia filters for enhanced audio/video codec support
  - Download from: https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases
  - Installation file included: `LAVFilters-0.80-Installer.exe`
  - Additional installation resources: `windows_install/` folder
  - **Required for**: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV video playback and various audio formats
  - **Installation**: Run as Administrator and follow the installer prompts

LAVFilters provides ffmpeg-based DirectShow splitter and decoders that enable the FlashCard application to play virtually any multimedia format on Windows systems.

## Installation

### Option 1: Automated Installation (Recommended)

The project includes automated installation scripts that handle virtual environment creation and dependency installation:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\install_flashcards_windows.ps1
```

**macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
chmod +x install_flashcards.sh
./install_flashcards.sh
```

These scripts will:
- Create a Python virtual environment named `flash_cards`
- Activate the environment
- Upgrade pip to the latest version
- Install all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`

### Option 2: Manual Installation

**1. Clone or download the application files**

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
python -m venv flash_cards
flash_cards\Scripts\activate
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
python -m venv flash_cards
.\flash_cards\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv flash_cards
source flash_cards/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Run the application:**
```bash
python flashcards.py
```

### Running the Application

After installation, you can use the provided run scripts:

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\run_flashcards_windows.ps1
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x run_flashcards.sh
./run_flashcards.sh
```

Or manually activate the environment and run:
```bash
# Windows
.\flash_cards\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python flashcards.py

# macOS/Linux
source flash_cards/bin/activate
python flashcards.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application won't start**
   - Check Python version (3.8+)
   - Verify PyQt5 installation: `pip install PyQt5`
   - Check console for error messages

2. **Media files not playing**
   - **Windows**: Ensure LAVFilters is installed (see Requirements section)
   - Verify file format is supported
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure PyQt5 multimedia components are installed

3. **Import/Export failures**
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify ZIP file integrity
   - Ensure sufficient disk space

4. **Performance issues**
   - Reduce image sizes
   - Limit video duration
   - Clean up unused media files

### Error Logs

Check `logs/error.log` for detailed error information. The application also maintains an in-memory error history accessible through the error dialog.

## Development

### Architecture

The application follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

- **Models**: Data structures for flash cards, sets, and content blocks
- **Views**: PyQt5 interfaces for different application modes
- **Controllers**: Application logic and mode management

### Adding New Content Block Types

1. Create new block class inheriting from `ContentBlock`
2. Implement required methods: `to_dict()`, `from_dict()`, `validate()`, `get_display_widget()`, `get_edit_widget()`
3. Add to factory function in `content_blocks.py`
4. Update UI dropdown in edit mode

### Adding New Study Modes

1. Extend `StudySessionManager` class
2. Update mode selector in view mode
3. Implement card ordering logic
4. Add to mode mapping in `ViewModeWidget`
